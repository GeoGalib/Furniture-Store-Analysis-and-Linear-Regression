Furniture Store Data Analysis and Linear Regression Model

Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of sales data from a furniture store to uncover key insights into revenue, sales, and profitability. In addition to data analysis, a linear regression model was developed to predict revenue based on various product features. Advanced visualizations were created to highlight the most profitable product categories.

Key Features

	•	Data Analysis: Detailed analysis of sales, revenue, and inventory.
	•	Data Visualization: Enhanced visualizations of the most profitable products by category.
	•	Machine Learning: A linear regression model built to predict revenue, achieving an accuracy of 40%.

Technologies Used

	•	Python: For data analysis and machine learning.
	•	Matplotlib: For creating customized visualizations.
	•	Pandas: For data manipulation and calculations.
	•	Tableau: For creating interactive visualizations (see link below).

Project Contents

1.	Furniture Store Analysis (Jupyter Notebook):
The notebook contains:
	•	Data analysis, including basic calculations such as total revenue and sales.
	•	Advanced visualizations showcasing product profitability.
	•	A linear regression model to predict revenue.
